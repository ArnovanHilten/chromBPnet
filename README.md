##  ChromBPNet

Chromatin profiles (DNASE-seq and ATAC-seq) exhibit multi-resolution shapes and spans regulated by co-operative binding of transcription factors (TFs). This complexity is further difficult to mine because of confounding bias from enzymes (DNASE-I/Tn5) used in these assays. Existing methods do not account for this complexity at base-resolution and do not account for enzyme bias correctly, thus missing the high-resolution architecture of these profile. Here we introduce ChromBPNet to address both these aspects.

ChromBPNet (shown in the image as `chrombpnet model`) is a fully convolutional neural network that uses dilated convolutions with residual connections to enable large receptive fields with efficient parameterization. It also performs automatic assay bias correction in two steps, first by learning simple model on chromatin background that captures the enzyme effect (called `bias model` in the image). Then we use this model to regress out the effect of the enzyme from the ATAC-seq/Dnase-seq profiles. This two step process ensures that the sequence component of the ChromBPNet model (called `sequence model`) does not learn enzymatic bias.

##  Tutorial on how to train chrombpnet models

Here we provide a step-by-step guide to training and evaluating chrombpnet models using the GM12878 ATAC-seq data (ENCSR095QNB) [here][url1]. This is bulk ATAC-seq data.

###  Preprocessing

#### Step 1: Download experimental data

We will first start by creating a directory named `data` and downloading the corresponding files (bams, overlap and idr peak sets) for ENCSR095QNB ENCODE dataset using the commans in the bash script below. 
```
bash step1_download_bams_and_peaks.sh

```

TODO - 
    - (define overlap and idr)
    - (When will we use overlap versus idr)
    - (Should bams be filtered or unfiltered)
    - (disuss how this will different for scATAC)


#### Step 2: Make Bigwigs from bam files (IMPORTANT STEP! PLEASE READ CAREFULLY)


We will now create unstranded bigwigs from the downloaded bam files (from step1) using the command below. This script uses the following two commands (1) `src/helpers/preprocessing/bam_to_bigwig.sh`: Considers that the given bam files are *unshifted* and does a shift of +4/-4 and (2) `src/helpers/preprocessing/analysis/build_pwm_from_bigwig.py` generates an image of the bias motif. 
```
bash step2_make_bigwigs_from_bams.sh data/merged.bam data/ ATAC_PE data/hg38.fa data/hg38.chrom.sizes
```

After running this command open the `bias_pwm.png` image generated by the script in this folder. You will see the following tn5 motif PWM.

![Image](images/bias_pwm.png)

**IMPORTANT NOTE 1:** If you are running these commands on custom experimental bam - *read the documentation* in the directory `$src/helpers/preprocessing/` to make sure you are using the script correctly. After that use this script `$src/helpers/preprocessing/analysis/` and making sure you see the tn5 bias pwm. If you do not see this it is likely the bam's that you provided have a shift of some kind. Please provide only unshifted bams to the script. **Do not proceed further if you do not see a tn5 motif after this step.** 

**IMPORTANT NOTE 2:** If you are running the pipeline on custom generarated bigwigs (without using `$src/helpers/preprocessing/`) make sure the bigwigs are unstranded and make sure the shifts are done correctly. To check this `$src/helpers/preprocessing/analysis/` run the scripts in this directory and make sure you see the tn5 pwm. *Do not proceed further if you do not see a tn5 motif after this step.* If you see another kind of motif as shown here - you have the incorrect shift. go back and fix this.

TODO - 
    - (define unstranded)
    - write analysis script to tell yes or no

#### Step 3: Generate background regions gc-matched with the peaks

Here we will generate non-peak background regions that gc-match with the peak regions. We will use the regions to train and evaluate a bias model. We will also use these regions as background regions to get marginal footprints.

First we will start by dividing the entire genome into overlapping bins of `inputlen` regions. ChromBpnet models are trained on `inputlen` of 2114 on human genome datasets. This value was chosen such that all chromatin features are captures and performance saturates. This step takes several hours (Sorry never got to speeding this step sinece its a one-time step, if you have ways to speed this step please contribute.) For conveinve the human genome (hg38) data we use is provided here -  /oak/stanford/groups/akundaje/anusri/refs/genomewide_gc_hg38_stride_50_inputlen_2114.bed. But if you want to make this file from scratch follow these steps

```
python src/helpers/make_gc_matched_negatives/get_genomewide_gc_buckets/get_genomewide_gc_bins.py -g data/hg38.fa -c data/hg38.chrom.sizes -o data/genomewide_gc_hg38_stride_50_inputlen_2114.bed -il 2114 --s 50
```

Now we will find the regions from this genome-wide bucket that do not fall in overlap-peaks or blacklist bed but have same gc-disribution as the overlap-peak set

```
bash step3_get_background_regions.sh data/hg38.fa data/hg38.chrom.sizes data/blacklist.bed.gz data/overlap.bed.gz 2114 data/ /oak/stanford/groups/akundaje/anusri/refs/genomewide_gc_hg38_stride_50_inputlen_2114.bed
```

TODO - provide link for all the documentation

###  Train and Evaluate Bias Model

We are now ready to train a bias model! We will first define how we want to split the dataset by menitoning out splits in `splits.py` and generating the corresponding json. If you want to mention custom splits please edit the `splits.py` file directly. This will generate five json files each with a different fold information. You can choose any fold for model training further. For the purpose of this tutorial we will use `fold_0.json`

```
mkdir data/splits
python src/helpers/make_chr_splits/splits.py -o data/splits
```

#### Step 4: Train Bias Model

This creates a directory `output/bias_model` and stores output here
This step consists of three steps - (1) Generate hyperparmeters file for bias model (2) Train bias model and (3) Predict and evaluate bias model. It is very improtant to read thhis section about the bias hyper-paramters - explain the threshold factor

```
bash step4_train_bias_model.sh data/shifted.sorted.bam.chrombpnet.unstranded.bw data/overlap.bed.gz data/negatives_with_summit.bed data/hg38.fa 0.9 2114 1000 data/splits/fold_0.json

```

How to interpret the output information. Important information about how bias model can catch motifs. So we will do Step 5 - If bias model catches motifs come back here and reduce the threshold and retrain. Careful not to use too few peaks. What worked for me best? 

#### Step 5: Interpret bias model

We can do this on the entire peak set - but we will do this on some subsampled data for a validation step.
subsample some peaks for interpretation and modisco - this is mostly for time purposes - we will subsample to 30K peaks. We will make sure that the peaks we choose dont overlap with the blacklist regions. 

```
inputlen=2114
blacklist_region=data/blacklist.bed.gz
chrom_sizes=data/hg38.chrom.sizes
overlap_peak=data/overlap.bed.gz

mkdir data/subsample_overlap

flank_size=$(( inputlen/2 ))
bedtools slop -i $blacklist_region -g $chrom_sizes -b $flank_size > data/subsample_overlap/temp.txt
bedtools intersect -v -a $overlap_peak -b data/subsample_overlap/temp.txt | shuf  > data/subsample_overlap/temp_n.txt
shuf -n 30000 data/subsample_overlap/temp_n.txt > data/subsample_overlap/30K.subsample.overlap.bed
rm  data/subsample_overlap/temp.txt
rm data/subsample_overlap/temp_n.txt
```

Interpretation 

```

```

#### Step 6: Scale bias model (IMPORTANT IF THE BIAS MODEL IS BEING TRANSFERED FROM A DIFFERENT EXPERIMENT)

This step is needed if we are transferring a bias model - this will normalize for the difference in read depth If the bias model is trained on an experiment on one read depth versus being used on another read depth. We are testing how well bias models generally transfer - one quick check is build the bias PWM on both the orginal experiment and transfer experiments and make sure the tn5 motifs looks similar.


###  Train and Evaluate ChromBPNet Model

Now that we have a bias model we will use it to regeress out the bias from the ATAC-seq and DNAE-seq signal so that the sequence component of the model can have bias free signal.

#### Step 7: Train ChromBPNet Model (This step will also generate the sequence model)


#### Step 8: Interpret chrombpnet model and sequence model


#### Step 9: Marginal footprinting using bias, chrombpnet ans sequence model
