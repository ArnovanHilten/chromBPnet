Some changes in these scripts

- added min_logcount and max_logcount limits
- subsampling experients on k562 using k562 500M bias and GM12878 bias (GM12878 undercorrected and K562 500M was fine)
- added get_loss weights with count thresholdign - but need to update these scripts
- invivo footprinting codes taken from Alex and tried running that
- K562 and GM12878 ATAC/DNASE experiments done
