October 8 log

- running universal atac models on the 5 cell-lines accounting for counts

October 9-11 log

- run universal atac models - but retrain them in the background
- run invivo mode for all cell lines with 128 filters and 4 dilations layers
- invivo - all done  
- retrain univ - all done
- wrap up invivo footprinting

October 12-14

- dsqtl plots with new models
- bqtl plots with new models

October 14 log - running

- train k562 invivo models with different threshold and 128 filters and 4 dilation layers
- train a full-blown bpnet bias model on universal atac - at mnt location
- train a full atac model on same threshold (min threshold)
- get invivo hits on subsampled experiments
- do variant analysis on gtex-variants form jesse
- ATAC_10.14.2021_withinvivobias_500filts_mincount - 500filter, 8 dilation layers, with min count same as before (mincount/2)
- ATAC_10.14.2021_withinvivobias - 128 filters, 4 dilation layers - np.quantile(0.1)//2

TODO -

- Get tracks for K562 ATAC and DNASE
- do variant analysis on pu1 whole data
- compare modisco hits across subsampled experiments
